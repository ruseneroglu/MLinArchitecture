## Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This blog created as a part of Machine Learning in Architecture, instructed by [Ozgun Balaban](https://github.com/AlpinistPanda), which is an Architectural Design Computing Graduate Program course at Istanbul Technical University.

## Final Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the final project, My group fellow; [Dilan](https://dilanoner.github.io/ML-Architecture/) and I considered that film scenes have spatial properties. So that we tried to work about the scene creation. In the film sector, this job worked by an art director and ext. During this phase, there are so many inputs. We thought that we can use these inputs as a tag. 
After [this video](https://vimeo.com/122378469?fbclid=IwAR0I8y4nC2gfigSMcmQTPYr0BKmsKN-39VZdNfv_rAXtGO_Dj8fMIG4tQ4U), we said that the last scenes can be produced according to the first scenes. And our final project started to form.
